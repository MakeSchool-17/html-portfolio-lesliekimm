				<div class="flex column">
					<p class="about-text">I am currently a Computer Science student at Make School in San Francisco looking for a full-time software engineering internship June - Dec of this year (2016). With a background in marketing, the fine arts and design and a passion for fitness, children's education and animals, I am looking to join a fun team to build awesome products. I built an iOS app called Talent Tracker during the first semester (shipping soon!) that helps event planners that book talent, manage whether or not talent is confirmed to appear/perform. The idea came from having worked in the stand up comedy industry for 2 years as VP, Head of Digital Media at the Laugh Factory. Currently, I am working through our web dev unit and very interested in pursuing a career in web development.</p>

					<p class="about-text">I have a diverse background, having studied marketing, art and film and having lived in DC, Savannah, NYC, LA, Seoul and now SF. I was always academic oriented, but my main hobby has been art since I was 3. It was the reason I went to Savannah College of Art and Design my freshman year. After a year, I decided to study marketing as my major instead and minor in fine arts so I transferred to NYU Stern. I also minored in the business of film because film was also a passion of mine. I went out to LA thinking I'd go into film production. But my day job was at the Laugh Factory and I eventually ran their digital media department. It was here that I discovered programming when I started debugging HTML/CSS and PHP on our website. I also would approve all work done on our dev site and began looking through the code with our programmers. I decided to go back to school to study Computer Science.</p>

					<p class="about-text">I went back to school part time because I went to help my family business full time. After a full year at Georgetown and a summer internship, I discovered Make School in San Francisco and made the decision to enroll. In one semster here, I've created an iOS app and am now working on our web dev unit. I am learning Ruby and Rails and have enjoyed my time at Make School building actual products.</p>

					<p class="about-text">In my spare time, I have always kept up with expanding my art portfolio. I am also a fitness and health enthusiast. I love being outdoors as much as possible, as so much of my time is spent behind a computer as much as I may enjoy it. It will also be obvious if you follow me on any social media platform that I am obsessed with my dog, Thumper. I have also been teaching most of my adult life. I began teaching summer art camps, eventually going on to be the Junior Director of the program when I was 16 at Little Picasso. In college and my post-college life, I have been teaching art, English and math privately. In a gap year of sorts, I went to Korea to learn about my heritage and culture and continued to teach English there. Now I am teaching for Girls Who Code in San Francisco. Working with our youth and being able to help shape them inspires me to think of ways to better impart knowledge.</p>
